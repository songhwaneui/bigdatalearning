    "## Good Morning, Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "The term _polymorphism_, in the OOP lingo, refers to the ability of an object to adapt the code to the type of the data it is processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism has two major applications in an OOP language. The first is that an object may provide different implementations of one of its methods depending on the type of the input parameters. The second is that code written for a given type of data may be used on data with a derived type, i.e. methods understand the class hierarchy of a type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python polymorphism is one of the key concepts, and we can say that it is a built-in feature. Let us deal with it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you know that in Python the type of a variable is not explicitly declared. Beware that this does not mean that Python variables are _untyped_. On the contrary, everything in Python has a type, it just happens that the type is implicitly assigned. If you remember the last paragraph of the previous post, I stated that in Python variables are just pointers (using a C-like nomenclature), in other words they just tell the language _where_ in memory a variable has been stored. What is stored at that address is not a business of the variable."

    "This little example shows a lot about the Python typing system. The variable `a` is not statically declared, after all it can contain only one type of data: a memory address. When we assign the number 5 to it, Python stores in `a` the _address_ of the number 5 (`0x83fe540` in my case, but your result will be different). The `type()` built-in function is smart enough to understand that we are not asking about the type of `a` (which is always a reference), but about the type of the content. When you store another value in `a`, the string `'five'`, Python shamelessly replaces the previous content of the variable with the new address.\n",

When you describe how to move an object by pushing it, you may explain it using a box, but you expect the person you are addressing to be able to repeat the action even if you need to move a pen, or a book, or a bottle.\n",

If you need to sum two numbers that can be integers, float or complex, you just need to write three `sum()` functions, one bound to the integer type, the second bound to the float type and the third bound to the complex type, and to have some language feature that takes charge of choosing the correct implementation depending on the input type. This logic can be implemented by a compiler (if the language is statically typed) or by a runtime environment (if the language is dynamically typed) and is the approach chosen by C++. The disadvantage of this solution is that it requires the programmer to forecast all the possible situations: what if I need to sum an integer with a float? What if I need to sum two lists? (Please note that C++ is not so poorly designed, and the operator overloading technique allows to manage such cases, but the base polymorphism strategy of that language is the one exposed here).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy, the one implemented by Python, is simply to require the input objects to solve the problem for you. In other words you _ask the data itself to perform the operation_, reversing the problem. Instead of writing a bunch of functions that sum all the possible types in every possible combination you just write one function that requires the input data to sum, trusting that they know how to do it. Does it sound complex? It is not.\n",

In the following sections we will talk about the [EAFP](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp) Python principle, and you will see that the delegation principle is somehow ubiquitous in this language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Hard\n",
    "\n",
    "Another real-life concept that polymorphism wants to bring into a programming language is the ability to walk the class hierarchy, that is _to run code on specialized types_. This is a complex sentence to say something we are used to do every day, and an example will clarify the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know how to open a door, it is something you learned in your early years. Under an OOP point of view you are an object (sorry, no humiliation intended) which is capable of interacting with a wood rectangle rotating on hinges. When you can open a door, however, you can also open a window, which, after all, is a specialized type of wood-rectangle-with-hinges, hopefully with some glass in it too. You are also able to open the car door, which is also a specialized type (this one is a mix between a standard door and a window). This shows that, once you know how to interact with the most generic type (basic door) you can also interact with specialized types (window, car door) as soon as they act like the ancestor type (e.g. as soon as they rotate on hinges).\n",
    "\n",
    "This directly translates into OOP languages: polymorphism requires that _code written for a given type may also be run on derived types_. For example, a list (a generic list object, not a Python one) that can contain \"numbers\" shall be able to accept integers because they _are_ numbers. The list could specify an ordering operation which requires the numbers to be able to compare each other. So, as soon as integers specify a way to compare each other they can be inserted into the list and ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statically compiled languages shall provide specific language features to implement this part of the polymorphism concept. In C++, for example, the language needs to introduce the concept of pointer compatibility between parent and child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python there is no need to provide special language features to implement subtype polymorphism. As we already discovered Python functions accept any variable without checking the type and rely on the variable itself to provide the correct methods. But you already know that a subtype must provide the methods of the parent type, either redefining them or through implicit delegation, so as you can see Python implements subtype polymorphism from the very beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this is one of the most important things to understand when working with this language. Python is not really interested in the actual type of the variables you are working with. It is interested in how those variables act, that is it just wants the variable _to provide the right methods_. So, if you come from statically typed languages, you need to make a special effort to think about _acting like_ instead of _being_. This is what we called \"duck typing\".\n",

    "## File Like Us\n",
    "\n",
    "File-like objects are a concrete and very useful example of polymorphism in Python. A file-like object is a class (or the instance of a class) that acts like a file, i.e. it provides those methods a file object exposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example that you code a class that parses an XML tree, and that you expect the XML code to be contained in a file. So your class accepts a file in its `__init__()` method, and reads the content from it\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "class XMLReader:\n",
    "    def __init__(xmlfile):\n",
    "        xmlfile.open()\n",
    "        self.content = xmlfile.read()\n",
    "        xmlfile.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def other(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The class works well until your application shall be modified to receive XML content from a network stream. To use the class without modifying it you shall write the stream in a temporary file and load this latter, but this sounds a little overkill. So you plan to change the class to accept a string, but this way you shall change every single code that uses the class to read a file, since now you shall open, read and close the file on your own, outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism offers a better way. Why not storing the incoming stream inside an object that _acts like_ a file, even if it is not an actual one? If you check the [`io`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html) module you will find that such an object has been already invented and provided in the standard Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other very useful file-like classes are those contained in the `gzip`, `bz2`, and `zipfile` modules (just to name some of the most used), which provide objects that allow you to manage compressed files just like plain files, hiding the decompression/compression machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unforgiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "EAFP is a Python acronym that stands for _easier to ask for forgiveness than permission_. This coding style is highly pushed in the Python community because it completely relies on the duck typing concept, thus fitting well with the language philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind EAFP is fairly easy: instead of checking if an object has a given attribute or method before actually accessing or using it, just trust the object to provide what you need and manage the error case. This can be probably better understood by looking at some code. According to EAFP, instead of writing\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "if hasattr(someobj, 'open'):\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you shall write\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    someobj.open()\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "except AttributeError:\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the second snippet directly uses the method and deals with the possible `AttributeError` exception (by the way: managing exceptions is one of the top Black Magic Topics in Python, more on it in a future post. A very quick preview: I think we may learn something from Erlang - check [this](/blog/2013/05/30/error-handling-in-erlang-a-primer/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this coding style pushed so much in the Python community? I think the main reason is that through EAFP you _think_ polymorphically: you are not interested in knowing if the object _has_ the `open` attribute, you are interested in knowing if the object can satisfy your request, that is to perform the `open()` method call.\n",
